Hi,
I'am Ngô Văn Mười, you can call me Ngô Mười.
I’m in my early twenties.
I'm living in Ho Chi Minh.
As of this writing, I am a final year student of HUFI, My major is Software Engineering.
I’m a great fan of soccer and I always spend my time playing soccer with my friends.
I'm a cheerful, easy-going person, but when it comes to work, I'm quite serious
